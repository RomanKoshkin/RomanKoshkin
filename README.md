### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 My current work spans
  - 語 simultaneous LLM-based machine translation
  - 🕵️ multiagent-based reasoning
  - 🧠 sample efficient learning and self-organization in spiking neural networks (SNNs)
- :handshake: I’m looking to collaborate on those things👆
- In the past I was involoved in
  - ⠵ developing unsupervised [convolutional](https://github.com/RomanKoshkin/conv-seq) and [GNN-based](https://github.com/RomanKoshkin/graph-seq) methods for detecting patterns in neural recordings
  - 🤖 building machine learning models for 💹 [neuromarketing](https://github.com/RomanKoshkin/NeuroBarometer) applications 
  - :rocket: re-implementing a model for [speech-decoding from M/EEG](https://github.com/arayabrain/speech-decoding)
  - developing [human-robot interaction](https://github.com/RomanKoshkin/human-robot-interaction) models
- 📫 Feel free to reach out and have a look at [my website](https://roman-koshkin.unit.oist.jp)
