### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 My current work spans
  - simultaneous LLM-based machine translation
  - agent-based reasoning and
  - sample efficient learning and episodic memory encoding in spiking neural networks
- :handshake: I’m looking to collaborate on those things👆.
- ⠵ In the past I was involoved in
  - developing unsupervised methods for detecting patterns in neural recordings.
  - :rocket: re-implementing META's [Decoding Speech from Non-invasive Brain Recordings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12266). See code [here](https://github.com/arayabrain/speech-decoding).
- 📫 Feel free to reach out and have a look at [my website](https://roman-koshkin.unit.oist.jp).
