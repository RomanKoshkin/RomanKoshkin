### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m developing recurrent network of binary neurons that will leverage self-organized connectivity structure for sample-efficient encoding of episodic memories.
- :rocket: I’m currently learning *CUDA C++* to super-charge my model's performance.
- :handshake: I’m looking to collaborate on *self-organization in biologically-plausible computatational models, sample-efficient memory encoding*.
- 💬 Ask me about anything.
- 📫 Want to learn more about/reach me, have a look at [my website](https://roman.koshkin.unit.oist.jp).
- 🐦 Follow me on twitter: [@nightdude4](https://twitter.com/nightdude4).
- :money_mouth_face: Fun fact: I develop bots for algorithmic trading with cryptocurrencies. Check out/fork one of them in [this repo](https://github.com/RomanKoshkin/ema_x_bot)!
