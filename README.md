### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 My current work spans
  - 語 simultaneous LLM-based machine translation
  - 🕵️ multiagent-based reasoning
  - 🧠 sample efficient learning and self-organization in spiking neural networks (SNNs)
- :handshake: I’m looking to collaborate on those things👆
- In the past I was involoved in
  - ⠵ developing unsupervised methods for detecting patterns in neural recordings
  - 🤖 building machine learning models for 💹 neuromarketing applications 
  - :rocket: re-implementing META's [speech-decoding from M/EEG](https://github.com/arayabrain/speech-decoding).
